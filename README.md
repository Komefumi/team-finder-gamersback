Alright, this was a wonderful experience. I've implemented a very good mockup.

I learned a number of things. Time management, having some enjoyment through coding, what I need to improve, and what my optimal way of working might be.

I've used SASS with CSS modules, React-Icons, Autosize.js (using React Refs as an escape hatch).

For deployment, I've used gh-pages but... for some reason the normal route wasn't working. So, I've made a script in the scripts folder, that being run with node would let me deploy. It does ask me thrice for the passphrase of my SSH Key.

The mockup implemented, is responsive or intended to be. I've taken some liberties here and there, but overall it's faithful to the original design handed to me.
